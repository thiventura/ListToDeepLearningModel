The Pipeline module is the user facing API for the Augmentor package. It
contains the :class:`~Augmentor.Pipeline.Pipeline` class which is used to
create pipeline objects, which can be used to build an augmentation pipeline
by adding operations to the pipeline object.

For a good overview of how to use Augmentor, along with code samples and
example images, can be seen in the :ref:`mainfeatures` section.

    The DataPipeline used to create augmented data that is not read from or
    saved to the hard disk. The class is provides beta functionality and will
    be incorporated into the standard Pipeline class at a later date.

    Its main purpose is to provide functionality for augmenting images
    that have multiple masks.

    See https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor/blob/master/notebooks/Multiple-Mask-Augmentation.ipynb
    for example usage.

    DataPipeline objects are initialised by passing images and their
    corresponding masks (grouped as lists) along with an optional list of
    labels. If labels are provided, the augmented images and its corresponding
    label are returned, otherwise only the images are returned. Image data
    is returned in array format.

    The images and masks that are passed can be of differing formats and
    have differing numbers of channels. For example, the ground truth data
    can be 3 channel RGB, while its mask images can be 1 channel monochrome.
